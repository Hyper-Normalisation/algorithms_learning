### Welcome to my algorithm documentation hub.

This repo's purpose is to document my learnings through DSA, Leetcode, and Codeforces. I will continue to update this repo every single week with new algorithms or
problems that I have learnt. 

Some goals of mine for over the next 12 months:

1. Leetcode Score: 500
2. Codeforces Rating: 2,000

I have below listed the algorithms that I am working through as well as the ones that I have completed.
